[`pls`](https://pls.cli.rs/) is a prettier and powerful `ls(1)` for the pros.

To install `pls` using Homebrew, follow these steps:

1. Add the tap:

   ```console
   $ brew tap pls-rs/pls
   ```

2. Install the formula:

   ```console
   $ brew install pls
   ```

Alternatively, you can use the short-form command.

```console
$ brew install pls-rs/pls/pls
```
